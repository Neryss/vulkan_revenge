## Notes to myself

1) Install [mingw](https://winlibs.com/#download-release)
2) Add to path bla bla
3) Create your project outside WSL, for example in C:/users/user/documents else it won't work when compiling libs
4) Then you can add your gcc path for mingw inside the makefile and run `make OS=Windows` then `powershell.exe .\vox.exe`
